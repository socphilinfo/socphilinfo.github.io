"Welcome to our Network Science Book Project, aimed at producing an
interactive textbook for network science. It is a work in progress, as we add
chapters as they are finalized. Currently you will find Chapter 1-2. It is
freely available under the Crative Commons licence for
[iPad](http://barabasilab.neu.edu/networksciencebook/downl.html) and in
[pdf](http://barabasilab.neu.edu/networksciencebook/downlPDF.html), together
with the [slides](http://barabasilab.neu.edu/courses/phys5116/) to teach the
material. Feel free to offer
[feedback](http://barabasilab.neu.edu/networksciencebook/blog/) and follow its
development on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/NetworkScienceBook),
