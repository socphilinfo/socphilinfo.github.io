Since 1995 the ETHICOMP conference series has provided a forum to discuss the
ethical and social issues surrounding Information and Communication
Technology. Over 900 papers have been presented at 12 conferences by
individuals from all parts of the world. But ETHICOMP is more than this ­ it
is an interdisciplinary community dedicated to exploring issues and seeking
ways forward. The next ETHICOMP conference will take place in June 2013 in
Kolding, Denmark.

The CEPE (Computer Ethics: Professional Enquiries) conferences are
international fora promoting dialogue between moral philosophy and the field
of information and communication technology (ICT).  They are sponsored by the
International Society for Ethics in Information Technology (INSEIT), founded
in 2000 with a focus on the ethical issues in and surrounding ICT. The next
CEPE conference will take place in Lisbon in July 2013.

In the summer of 2014 (June/July), the ETHICOMP and CEPE conferences will hold
their first joint conference.
