**CEPE-IACAP 2015 Joint Conference**

**June 22-25 2015 at the University of Delaware**

Philosophical and ethical enquiries about information technologies, computing,
and artificial intelligence have acquired a focal place in the academic and
societal debate on the design, development and deployment of technological
artefacts. As the issues to be addressed are increasingly complex and
interwoven, the need to consider different stakeholders and to endorse both
multi- and inter-disciplinary approaches in addressing such problems become
more pressing. For this reason, in 2015 INSEIT and IACAP will hold a joint
meeting to offer the opportunity to members of both communities to exchange
ideas and discuss issues of common interest.

The conference will be held on June 22-25 2015 at the University of Delaware
and will be hosted by Professor Tom Powers, Department of Philosophy, School
of Public Policy and Administration and Delaware Biotechnology Institute, and
Director of the Center for Science, Ethics & Public Policy, University of
Delaware.

This year’s meeting will have a single main track focusing on topics at the
core of IACAP and INSEIT member’s interests. Symposia will also be organized
and run by members, or member groups, to focus on more specific topics of
discussion.

We invite submissions of abstract (up to 3000 words) as well as submission of
proposals for symposia focusing on ethical and philosophical problems relate
to information technologies and computing. A selection of the papers presented
during the meeting will be published in a volume of the ‘Synthese Library’
(Springer).
