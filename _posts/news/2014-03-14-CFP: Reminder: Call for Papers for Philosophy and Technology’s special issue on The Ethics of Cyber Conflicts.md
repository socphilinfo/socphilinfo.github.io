INTRODUCTION

In the age of the so-called information revolution, the ability to control,
disrupt or manipulate the enemy’s information infrastructure has become as
decisive as weapon superiority with respect to determining the outcome of
conflicts. So much so that the Pentagon defines cyberspace as a new domain in
which war is waged, alongside land, sea, air and space.

Cyber conflicts, as part of a state’s defensive or offensive strategy, are a
fast growing phenomenon, which is rapidly changing the dynamics of combat as
well as the role that warfare plays in political negotiations and the life of
civil societies. Such changes are not the exclusive concern of the military.
They also have a significant bearing on ethicists and policymakers, since
existing ethical theories of war, together with national and international
regulations, struggle to address the novelties of this phenomenon. The issue
could not be more pressing and there is a much felt and fast escalating need
to share information and coordinate ethical theorising about cyber conflicts.

This special issue of Springer’s Philosophy & Technology
(<http://www.springer.com/13347>) follows the organization of the
international workshop on Ethics of Cyber Conflict
(<http://www.ccdcoe.org/428.html>), held on November 21-22, 2013 at the Centro
Alti Studi per la Difesa (CASD) with the support of the NATO Cooperative Cyber
Defense Centre of Excellence.



TOPICS

We solicit the submission of papers that investigate issues concerning the way
ICTs are affecting our ethical views of conflicts and warfare, as well as the
analysis of just-war principles in the light of the dissemination of cyber
conflicts; humanitarian military interventions based on ICTs; whether
preventive acts of cyber war may satisfy jus-ad-bellum criteria; challenges of
upholding jus-in-bello standards in cyber warfare, especially in asymmetric
conflicts; attribution and proportionality of the response to cyber attacks;
moral permissibility of automated responses and ethical deployment of military
robotic weapons.
