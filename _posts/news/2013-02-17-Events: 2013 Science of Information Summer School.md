In cooperation with the NSF Center for Science of Information (CSoI), Info-
Metrics will sponsor up to (potentially) 12 PhD (post graduate) students and
Affiliates for participating in the  **2013 Science of Information Summer
School**  on Tuesday, June 04, 2013 - Friday, June 07, 2013, at Purdue
University. For more information on this 3-day program see:

<http://soihub.org/itschool.php>

Approximately 6 of these will be current advanced PhD students at American
University who are working on Info-metrics related research. The rest of the
spots are open to our Affiliate and their students. Specifically, if you are
interested in the Summer School, or you have a student that you like to send
to that class please let us know.

Info-Metrics will:

1\.        Take care of the registration costs and registration.

2\.        Share in covering the domestic/international airfare (if needed).

We expect that the Affiliates who nominate student/s will share some (or all
if possible) of the travel costs, but we leave this open for negotiations (on
an individual basis/need).

Interested Affiliates should email Aisha at [info-
metrics@american.edu](mailto:info-metrics@american.edu) no later than Friday,
February 22 by 5 PM with the subject line: Summer School.

Please state the name/s of your student/s, their research area and status
(i.e., PhD second year, post-grad, etc.).

Priority will be given to Affiliates who are interested in taking that class.
If you nominate more than a single student, please rank them.

(Note that your students can also register directly and independently of Info-
Metrics once the official registration opens.)
