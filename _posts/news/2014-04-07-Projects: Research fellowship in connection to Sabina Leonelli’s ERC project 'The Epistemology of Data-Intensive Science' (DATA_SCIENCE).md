The Department of Sociology, Philosophy & Anthropology of the University of
Exeter (UK) is advertising a research fellowship in connection to Sabina
Leonelliâ€™s ERC project 'The Epistemology of Data-Intensive Science'
(DATA_SCIENCE). The fellowship is available from 1 October 2014 until 31 March
2018. The successful applicant will investigate how the use of online
databases is affecting research practices and outcomes in biomedicine. This
study will be carried out in collaboration with scholars conducting similar
research on other fields, so as to facilitate comparison across different
sciences. The successful applicant will have a PhD or equivalent in the
philosophy, history and/or social studies of biomedicine or related areas of
information studies. The ability to conduct ethnographic research is desirable
but not essential, as long as the applicant is willing to be trained as
required to conduct this type of research.

The deadline for applications is 29 April 2014; interviews are expected to
take place on 27 May 2014.
