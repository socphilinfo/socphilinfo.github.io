Information Warfare: A Response to Taddeo  
Tim Stevens  
Philosophy and Technology (forthcoming)  
Abstract: Taddeo's recent article, 'Information Warfare: A Philosophical
Perspective' ( Philos. Technol. 25:105â€“120, 2012 ) is a useful addition to the
literature on information communications technologies (ICTs) and warfare. In
this short response, I draw attention to two issues arising from the article.
The first concerns the applicability of 'information warfare' terminology to
current political and military discourse, on account of its relative lack of
contemporary usage. The second engages with the political and ethical
implications of treating ICT environments as a 'domain', with its
ramifications for the pursuit of 'dominion', particularly through military
action.
