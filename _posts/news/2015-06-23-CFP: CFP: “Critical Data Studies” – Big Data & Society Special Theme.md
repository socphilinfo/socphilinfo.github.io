**CFP: “Critical Data Studies” – Big Data & Society Special Theme**  
  
Guest Editors: Andrew Iliadis (Purdue University) and Federica Russo
(Universiteit van Amsterdam)  
  
Critical Data Studies (CDS) is a growing field of research that focuses on the
unique theoretical, ethical, and epistemological challenges posed by “Big
Data.” Rather than treat Big Data as a scientifically empirical, and therefore
largely neutral phenomena, CDS advocates the view that data should be seen as
always-already constituted within wider data assemblages. Assemblages is a
concept that helps capture the multitude of ways that already-composed data
structures inflect and interact with society, its organization and
functioning, and the resulting impact on individuals’ daily lives. CDS
questions the many assumptions about data that permeate contemporary
literature on information and society by locating instances where data may be
naively taken to denote objective and transparent informational entities.  
  
CDS may be viewed as an emerging field connected to Information Ethics,
Software Studies, and Critical Information Studies in that it seeks to
question the ethical import of information and Big Data for society. Problems
of causality, quality, security, and uncertainty concern CDS scholars. Recent
articles outlining the theoretical program of CDS offer a new platform from
which to question data in this manner. We seek essays for this special volume
that broaden these latest commitments in CDS to include new empirical research
projects on information and communication technologies (ICTs) that fall under
the umbrella of Big Data, while also seeking to question their attendant
epistemological shifts. Through the critical lens of ethics and morality, this
special volume opens up CDS to localizations where Big Data can no longer be
seen as neutral, and where an ethics of Big Data might emerge.  
  
Issues of interest include (but are not limited to):  
\- Causality: how should we find causes in the era of ‘data-driven science?’
Do we need a new conception of causality to fit with new practices?  
\- Quality: how should we ensure that data are good enough quality for the
purposes for which we use them? What should we make of the open access
movement; what kind of new technologies might be needed?  
\- Security: how can we adequately secure data, while making it accessible to
those who need it? How do we protect databases?  
\- Uncertainty: can Big Data help with uncertainty, or does it generate new
uncertainties? What technologies are essential to reduce uncertainty elements
in data-driven sciences?  
  
Proposals of 1000 words are invited for consideration and inclusion in the
Special Theme to be published in Big Data & Society (BD&S), an open access
peer-reviewed scholarly journal that publishes interdisciplinary work
principally in the social sciences, humanities and computing and their
intersections with the arts and natural sciences about the implications of Big
Data for societies.  
  
Manuscripts should be 8,000 words for an Original Research Article, 3,000
words for a Commentary, and 1,000 words for an essay in the Early Career
Research Forum section. All submissions of Original Research Articles to BD&S
are double-blind, and triple peer-reviewed. Commentaries and ECR submissions
are reviewed by the Guest Editors.  
  
Proposals should be sent to the Guest Editors: ailiadis@purdue.edu and
f.russo@uva.nl
