### About the Issue

25 years ago, Sandra Harding—in her influential book _Whose Science? Whose
Knowledge? Thinking from Women’s Lives_—detailed and extended critical debates
surrounding knowledge production and practices in science and technology.
Collectively, these “countercultures of science” confronted the “problematics,
agendas, ethics, and consequences” of scientific and technological production
head on. Today, these same perspectives offer  
insight into the realm of data science, as philosophers, scholars, and
practitioners alike grapple with ethical questions in a world where  
discourse, design, and governance increasingly revolve around “big” data and
quantifiable knowledge.

This special issue will bring together rigorous conceptual and theoretical
perspectives on what might best be called—following Harding—emerging  
“countercultures of data.” In particular, this issue will further critical and
philosophical thinking about the theories, methods, institutions, and  
technological arrangements that underwrite or support data science in various
industries and forms. Combined, contributions to the special issue  
will put forward a more realistic assessment of possible futures for a data
driven world.
