Synthese December 2013, Volume 190, Issue 18, pp 4331-4359

Constructor theory seeks to express all fundamental scientific theories in
terms of a dichotomy between  _possible_  and  _impossible_  physical
transformationsâ€“those that can be caused to happen and those that cannot. This
is a departure from the prevailing conception of fundamental physics which is
to predict what  _will happen_ from initial conditions and laws of motion.
Several converging motivations for expecting constructor theory to be a
fundamental branch of physics are discussed. Some principles of the theory are
suggested and its potential for solving various problems and achieving various
unifications is explored. These include providing a theory of information
underlying classical and quantum information; generalising the theory of
computation to include all physical transformations; unifying formal
statements of conservation laws with the stronger operational ones (such as
the ruling-out of perpetual motion machines); expressing the principles of
testability and of the computability of nature (currently deemed
methodological and metaphysical respectively) as laws of physics; allowing
exact statements of emergent laws (such as the second law of thermodynamics);
and expressing certain apparently anthropocentric attributes such as knowledge
in physical terms.
