The proceedings from the Sixth Symposium at Royaumont in 1962 were titled Le

Information in Contemporary Science) and were published three years later in
Paris in 1965 by Les Éditions de Minuit.

In attendance were Norbert Wiener, Gilbert Simondon, Martial Gueroult, Giorgio
de Santillana, Lucien Goldmann, Benoit Mandelbrot, René de Possel, Jean
Hyppolite, André Michel Lwoff, Abraham Moles, Ferdinand Alquié, Henryk
Greniewski, Helmar Frank, Jiri Zeman, François Bonsack, Louis Couffignal,
