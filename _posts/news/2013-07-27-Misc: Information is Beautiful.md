> I’m David McCandless, a London-based author, writer and designer. I’ve
written for The Guardian, Wired and others. I’m into anything strange and
interesting.  
>  These days I’m an independent **data journalist** and **information
designer**. A passion of mine is visualizing information – facts, data, ideas,
subjects, issues, statistics, questions – all with the minimum of words.  
>  I’m interested in how designed information can help us understand the
world, cut through BS and reveal the hidden connections, patterns and stories
underneath. Or, failing that, it can just look cool!
