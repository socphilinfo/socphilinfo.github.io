CEPE-IACAP 2015 Joint Conference

Posted on [November 23, 2014](http://www.iacap.org/cepe-iacap-2015-joint-
conference/ "21:15")

June 22-25 2015 at the University of Delaware

Philosophical and ethical enquiries about information technologies, computing,
and artificial intelligence have acquired a focal place in the academic and
societal debate on the design, development and deployment of technological
artefacts. As the issues to be addressed are increasingly complex and
interwoven, the need to consider different stakeholders and to endorse both
multi- and inter-disciplinary approaches in addressing such problems become
more pressing. For this reason, in 2015 INSEIT ([International Society for
Ethics and Information Technology](http://inseit.net/)) and IACAP
([International Association for Computing and
Philosophy](http://www.iacap.org/)) will hold a joint meeting to offer the
opportunity to members of both communities to exchange ideas and discuss
issues of common interest.

The conference will be held on June 22-25 2015 at the University of Delaware
and will be hosted by Professor Tom Powers, Department of Philosophy, School
of Public Policy and Administration and Delaware Biotechnology Institute, and
Director of the Center for Science, Ethics & Public Policy, University of
Delaware.
