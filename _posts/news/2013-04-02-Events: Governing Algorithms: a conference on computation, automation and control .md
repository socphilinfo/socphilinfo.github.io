title: 'Events: Governing Algorithms: a conference on computation, automation and
  control '
---
New York University  
May 16-17, 2013

Algorithms are increasingly invoked as powerful entities that control, govern,
sort, regulate, and shape everything from financial trades to news media.
Nevertheless, the nature and implications of such orderings are far from
clear. What exactly is it that algorithms “govern”? What is the role
attributed to “algorithms” in these arguments? Can we turn the “problem of
algorithms” into an object of productive inquiry?

This conference sets out to explore the recent rise of algorithms as an object
of interest in scholarship, policy, and practice beyond computer science.
Taking a fresh view on the current wave of interest in this topic.
