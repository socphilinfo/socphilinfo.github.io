title: 'CFP: Archives and the Philosophy of Information'
---
The 2017 edition of the S@P yearbook, a collection of essays and scholarly
articles published by the [Dutch Society for Archival
Publications](http://www.archiefpublicaties.nl/), will be devoted to archives
and information philosophy. Its goal is to give a broad review of archival
concepts and principles from perspectives of information philosophy (IP), with
a focus on the implications of the information revolution for records and
their functions in society at a philosophical (fundamental), logical
(structural) and ethical (practical) level, and with the explicit aim of
understanding how can archival concepts, principles and practices should adapt
to this revolution.

The editors seek contributions that are inspired by the philosophy of
information (as a conceptual framework) and by archival theory (as an applied
science), and particularly welcome proposals that would contribute to a
dialogue between these disciplines (see also the interview with Luciano
Floridi in a[ recent
publication](http://www.kvan.nl/files/AB_jan_2015_def.pdf) of the KVAN).

Proposals for chapters (max 10.000 words) should be directed to the editors:

  * [Rienk Jonker ](mailto:rienkjonker@gmail.com)(city archivist of Leeuwarden and archival theorist)
  * [Arnoud Glaudemans ](mailto:a.glaudemans@hilversum.nl)(records management inspector of Hilversum and philosopher)
  * [Frans Smit ](mailto:fpsmit@gmail.com)(information policies advisor of Almere and historian).

### Practical

  * Proposals: April 1st, 2016
  * Submission of manuscripts: Februari 1st, 2017
  * Publication: 2017/18
