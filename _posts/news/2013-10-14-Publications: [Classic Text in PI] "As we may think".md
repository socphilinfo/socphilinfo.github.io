This essay by Vannevar Bush was published in 1945 in the Atlantic Monthly. He
describes a system called the memex, a tool for making knowledge more
accessible, that is often considered to be one of the precursors of hypertext.

A quote from the editor of the Atlantic

> Like Emerson's famous address of 1837 on "The American Scholar," this paper
by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationship between thinking man and the sum of
our knowledge.

And one from the essay itself:

> The summation of human experience is being expanded at a prodigious rate,
and the means we use for threading through the consequent maze to the
momentarily important item is the same as was used in the days of square-
rigged ships. (...)

>

> Two centuries ago Leibnitz invented a calculating machine which embodied
most of the essential features of recent keyboard devices, but it could not
then come into use. The economics of the situation were against it: the labor
involved in constructing it, before the days of mass production, exceeded the
labor to be saved by its use, since all it could accomplish could be
duplicated by sufficient use of pencil and paper. (...)

>

> Babbage, even with remarkably generous support for his time, could not
produce his great arithmetical machine. His idea was sound enough, but
construction and maintenance costs were then too heavy. (...)

>

> The world has arrived at an age of cheap complex devices of great
reliability; and something is bound to come of it.
