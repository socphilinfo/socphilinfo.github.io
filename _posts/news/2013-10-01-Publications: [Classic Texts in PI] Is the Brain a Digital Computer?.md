In various venues, Searle has addressed the question of whether the 'brain as
computer' metaphor is useful for philosophy of mind and cognitive science.

> Because we do not understand the brain very well we are constantly tempted
to use the latest technology as a model for trying to understand it. In my
childhood we were always assured that the brain was a telephone switchboard.
('What else could it be?') I was amused to see that Sherrington, the great
British neuroscientist, thought that the brain worked like a telegraph system.
Freud often compared the brain to hydraulic and electro-magnetic systems.
Leibniz compared it to a mill, and I am told some of the ancient Greeks
thought the brain functions like a catapult. At present, obviously, the
metaphor is the digital computer.
