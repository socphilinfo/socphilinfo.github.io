An interdisciplinary workshop on Information: Space, Time, and Identity  
The Open University and the MK Gallery, Milton Keynes, UK

8-10 April 2013  
The Difference That Makes a Difference series of workshops is a forum for
interdisciplinary sharing of insights on the nature of information.

The first workshop (DTMD 2011) took place in Milton Keynes 7th-9th September
2011 with delegates from across the world and representing a wide range of
disciplines.

This second workshop follows the pattern of the first, with a specific focus
on Space, Time and Identity, as well as as special session asking What is
information? A special highlight of this workshop will be the production of
artwork responding to these themes.

The final plenary will be held in Milton Keynes Gallery and begin with a talk
by Luciano Floridi followed by a panel of the session keynote speakers.

The whole event will be freely available for viewing via a live webcast.
