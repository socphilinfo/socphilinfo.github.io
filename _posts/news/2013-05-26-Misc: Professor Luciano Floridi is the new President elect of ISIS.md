Professor [Luciano

Floridi") is the new President elect of the [International Society for
Information Studies](http://www.is4is.org/ "ISIS"). The General Assembly of
ISIS, held in Moscow on 23 May 2013, elected him unanimously, with immediate
effect.

As President Elect, Prof. Floridi will become President in 2015. To prepare
his period of Presidency he will support the current President in shaping the
future development strategy of the organisation.

ISIS is an umbrella organization for all academics, students and practitioners
as well as groups, networks and legal entities that are committed to the
advancement of Information Studies. Information Studies comprise all areas
that use a scientific methodology to understand, explain and model information
processes in natural, social and artificial systems for the (re-)design of
those processes.

Prof. Floridi will be the keynote speaker at the next international congress
to be held in Vienna.
