Perhaps not a "classic," but at least for me it is the place where I learned
that what I was doing already had a name: "The Philosophy of Information".

A not so randomly chosen quote:

> As an utterly new and revolutionary technology, databases have raised a
number of philosophical issues, some of which can be briefly discussed here,
but will need to be analysed in full by any future philosophy of information.

>

> The conceptual framework provided by database technology can help us to
clarify the meaning of “data”, “information” and “knowledge” (DIK), by
sketching a query or erotetic model (erotetic logic is the logic of questions
and answers). A datum is anything that makes a difference: a light in the
dark, a black dot on a white page, a 1 opposed to a 0, a sound in the silence.
(...)

>

> To become informative for an intelligent being, a datum must be functionally
associated with a relevant query. Thus a piece of information can be defined
as a semantic molecule consisting of (datum a relevant question): 12 becomes
informative once we know that it is the answer to the question “how many
apostles were there?” Note that a datum does not need to be the correct answer
to function as a proper compound of a semantic molecule: disinformation and
propaganda are still forms of information, no matter whether wrong or
incorrect. What is knowledge then? An embarrassingly old question. In our
erotetic model, information becomes knowledge only if it is associated with
the relevant explanation of the reasons why things are the way they are said
to be. Knowledge involves understanding, not merely the contingent possession
of a correct justification, and therefore insight, and can be defined as a
body of (information a relevant explanation). (...)

>

> The result of the previous analysis is that there are many more data than
corresponding items of information, and the greatest part of our epistemic
life is based on true information, not on knowledge, since understanding is a
rare and often unnecessary phenomenon. (...)
