title: 'Publications: Cyber Security and Individual Rights, Striking the Right Balance'
---
In this article, I offer an outline of the papers comprising the special
issue. I also provide a brief overview of its topic, namely, the friction
between cyber security measures and individual rights. I consider such a
friction to be a new and exacerbated version of what Mill called ‘the struggle
between liberties and authorities,’ and I claim that the struggle arises
because of the involvement of public authorities in the management of the
cyber sphere, for technological and state power can put individual rights,
such as privacy, anonymity and freedom of speech, under sharp devaluating
pressure. Finally, I conclude by stressing the need to reach an ethical
balance to fine-tune cyber security measures and individual rights
