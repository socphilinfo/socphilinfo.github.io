Critical Data Studies (CDS) explore the unique cultural, ethical, and critical
challenges posed by Big Data. Rather than treat Big Data as only
scientifically empirical and therefore largely neutral phenomena, CDS
advocates the view that Big Data should be seen as always-already constituted
within wider data assemblages. Assemblages is a concept that helps capture the
multitude of ways that already-composed data structures inflect and interact
with society, its organization and functioning, and the resulting impact on
individualsâ€™ daily lives. CDS questions the many assumptions about Big Data
that permeate contemporary literature on information and society by locating
instances where Big Data may be naively taken to denote objective and
transparent informational entities.
