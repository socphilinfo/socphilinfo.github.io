title: 'Publications: The meaning of information by Doede Nauta'
---
This is a classic text that has been left quite under-appreciated. It offers a
semiotic analysis of information, but the pragmatic theory of information
extends beyond the semiotic tradition. In my view, this is one of the best and
most sophisticated accounts of information.

The book is out of print, so check your institution library. A few left on
