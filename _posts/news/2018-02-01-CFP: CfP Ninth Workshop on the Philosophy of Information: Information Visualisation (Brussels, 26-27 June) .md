_Ninth Workshop on the Philosophy of Information: Information Visualisation_

June 26-27 2018

Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and Arts, Brussels

Website: [https://socphilinfo.github.io/workshops/wpi9](/workshops/wpi9).

Submissions are invited for the Ninth Workshop on the Philosophy of
Information, which will take place at the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for
Science and Arts in Brussels, 26thâ€“27th of June 2018, just before [SPSP 2018
in Ghent](http://www.spsp2018.ugent.be).

**Call for Papers**

The theme of the workshop is **information visualisation**.  

Our aim is to focus on informational artefacts that encode or convey
information in order to try and explain why visualisations can play a certain
epistemic role and why certain visualisation are more effective than others. A
special attention will be given to the study of how scientists rely on
visualisations and how visual artefacts are designed in the sciences. On this
basis, we wish to explore convergences between the philosophy of information
and the philosophy of science as well as between the formal sciences (logic,
computing) and the philosophy of information. We therefore encourage scholars
of various disciplinary backgrounds to explore the lines of inquiry we
propose.

Topics of interest include:

  * Extensions and critical evaluations of visualisations as models and as epistemic representations in the context of data-intensive science.
  * The epistemology of data and data science in the context of visualisation.
  * The logic and epistemology of design in the context of information visualisation.
  * Case-studies of specific visualisation-practices or types of visualisations; including drawings, photographs and diagrams.
  * Meta-theoretical reflections on the status of theoretical foundations for information visualisation.
  * The role of formal methods for the study of visualisation.

**How to submit an abstract**

Abstracts of **500-1000 words** should be submitted no later than 30 March
2018 (**new date**) to socphilinfo@gmail.com. Submissions will be evaluated by the [programme
committee](https://socphilinfo.github.io/workshops/wpi9/pc.html), and notification of
acceptance will be issued by 15 April 2018.

**Organisation and contact**

The workshop is organised by the [Society for the Philosophy of
Information](https://socphilinfo.github.io).
