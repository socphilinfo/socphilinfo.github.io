In 8 February there was an event in Brussels organised by the European
Commission: the launch of the Onlife Manifesto. In [this blog
post](http://federicogobbo.wordpress.com/2013/02/18/concept-reengineering-
needed-for-our-hyperconnected-era/) you can read a personal account of that
day, where the Philosophy of Information was mentioned and used a lot of
times.
