### Introduction

Digital technologies of the 21st century are profoundly transforming the
nature of evidence and evidential practices in a wide range of domains,
including science, medicine, law, education, journalism, government, public
policy and global, national and domestic security. These changes call for
rigorous analysis and critical reflection across a range of related topics and
disciplines.

The effects and uses are as diverse as the technologies themselves. The much-
heralded power of “Big Data” on an unprecedented scale is radically changing
how, and from where, social science researchers, marketers and insurers draw
their evidence of human behavior, desires and attitudes. Digital neuroimaging
technologies are reshaping norms of evidence in the courtroom, in research
labs and in doctors’ offices. Varied forms of drone imaging affect how
military pilots and intelligence agencies identify and even define legitimate
targets, how archeologists, marine biologists, geologists and conservation
scientists understand and measure natural phenomena, and how local law
enforcement agencies perceive crime and social unrest. Cellphone cameras, body
cameras, webcams and hacked ‘data dumps’ have radically changed how, and what,
the public sees and knows. Future innovations in digital evidence promise to
destabilize traditional evidential norms and practices even further.

The philosophical questions raised by such transformations are many. What if
any conceptual shifts in traditional metaphysics and epistemology do these new
evidential practices suggest? Are new ontologies of evidence, or new standards
of justified belief and knowledge, needed to account for them? What normative
considerations (epistemic, political, ethical or legal), should be brought to
bear upon these developments? How do new digital technologies condition the
relationship between evidence, knowledge, belief and trust? How do these
changes affect our understanding of scientific inquiry and explanation, or the
role of evidential practices in human cognition, affectivity and action? How
are these technologies impacting the distribution of the social and political
power of evidence? These are just a few of the critical questions that new and
emerging evidential practices invite us to ask.

## Topics

We solicit the submission of papers that investigate the way in which new and
emerging digital technologies are changing evidential norms and practices,
within any relevant practical context or contexts (e.g. natural or social
science, law, journalism, public policy, medicine, security or intelligence,
etc). While the motivating questions should be of a philosophical nature, we
welcome submissions from any discipline and/or subdiscipline (for example:
philosophy/sociology of science, ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, logic,
law, psychology, media studies, criminal justice, political
philosophy/science, and so on.)  
  
Topics of special interest include: the impact of digital evidence on
scientific research standards and practices; on the role of expertise; on
notions of justification, confirmation and reasonable belief; on epistemic
assessments of trust, reliability, objectivity and/or truth; on the
cultivation of intellectual or moral virtues; on the relationship between
modes of perception, affect, reflection and judgment; on individual, group and
institutional practices of deliberation, verification and decision; or on the
collection, dissemination, integrity and authority of information.
