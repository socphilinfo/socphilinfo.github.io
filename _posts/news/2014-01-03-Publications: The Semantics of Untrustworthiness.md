## Abstract

We offer a formal treatment of the semantics of both complete and incomplete
mistrustful or distrustful information transmissions. The semantics of such
relations is analysed in view of rules that define the behaviour of a
receiving agent. We justify this approach in view of human agent
communications and secure system design. We further specify some properties of
such relations.
