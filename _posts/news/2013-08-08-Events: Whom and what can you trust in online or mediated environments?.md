**Faculty workshop ­ PhD workshop ­ Public Debate - Whom ­ and what ­ can you
trust in online / mediated environments?**

Interdisciplinary Perspectives in Philosophy, Computer Science, Media Studies.
Department of Media and Communication, University of Oslo.

Over the past decade, increasing attention has been given to questions of
trust and privacy in online and mediated environments. These questions are
complicated by important differences between face-to-face and online/mediated
experiences of trust and privacy - and further complicated by the increasingly
important roles of Artificial Agents (AAs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) such
as those at work in ³recommendations for you on commercial websites, web-page
ranking algorithms used in popular search engines, and so on. At the same
time, AAs and MASs are becoming increasingly autonomous ­ capable of making
decisions independently of human control. Such autonomy raises centrally
philosophical questions:  Are such AAs and MASs further capable of making
autonomous ethical judgments ­including the specific sort of judgment denoted
by phronesis or practical wisdom?  And: how would we know if we can or should
trust these agents ­precisely as they become increasingly indispensible to our
lives?
