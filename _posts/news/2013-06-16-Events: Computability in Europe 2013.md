Cie2013 is the annual conference of the Computability in Europe Association.

The conference will take place on  **July, 1st-5th, 2013**  at the [Univ. of
Milano-Bicocca](http://www.unimib.it/ "Univ. Milano-Bicocca").  
The conference is co-located with the conference [Unconventional Computation &
Natural Computation 2013 (UCNC 2013)](http://ucnc2013.disco.unimib.it/).

The  _Nature of Computation_  is meant to emphasize the special focus of CiE13
on the unexpected and strong changes that studies on Nature have brought in
several areas of mathematics, physics, and computer science. Starting from
Alan Turing, research on Nature with a computational perspective has produced
novel contributions, giving rise even to new disciplines.

The conference will address all these aspects besides the more established
lines of research of Computational Complexity and the interplay between Proof
Theory and Computation.
