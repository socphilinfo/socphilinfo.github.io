The [Journal of Logic and Computation](http://logcom.oxfordjournals.org) (OUP)
has launched a new section devoted to _Logic and Philosophy of Information_
edited by Luciano Floridi and Marcello D'Agostino. The editors welcome papers
on the relationship between logic and information, including philosophical
aspects, provided they have a mathematical/computational content.

From the
[editorial](http://logcom.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/3/525.full.pdf+html):

> While the existence of a fundamental relationship between logic and
information seems unquestionable, its precise nature has so far proved to be
rather elusive and somewhat puzzling. The received view on this issue is
epitomized by the traditional tenet that logical inference is ‘tautological’
(literally, repetitive and trivially true), namely that a valid inference is
one in which the information carried by the conclusion is (in a sense
variously specified) contained in the information carried by the (conjunction
of the) premises. At the mid of the 20th century, Bar-Hillel and Carnap’s
controversial theory of ‘semantic information’ provided what is, to date, the
strongest theoretical justification for this tenet. However, as remarked by a
number of authors who have made the history of logic, including Frege, Dummett
and Hintikka, the received view clashes with the intuitive idea that deductive
arguments are useful just because, by their means, we obtain information that
we did not possess before. Moreover, it also clashes with two 20th-century
milestones of the theory of computation: the undecidability of first-order
logic and the NP-hardness of propositional logic. How can logic be
informationally trivial and, yet, computationally hard? Can we obtain an
informational characterization of logical consequence that is more in tune
with our intuition and with the negative results on the computational
complexity of logical reasoning? [read
