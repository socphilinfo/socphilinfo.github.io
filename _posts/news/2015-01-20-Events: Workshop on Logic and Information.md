## Description

The juxtaposition of ‘logic’ and ‘information’ is popular as well as
controversial: It is clear that there must be a connection between both, but
there is hardly any agreement about the precise nature of the connection. When
we focus on how information can clarify what logic is about, it is natural to
say that valid arguments are just those arguments where the content of the
conclusion does not exceed the combined content of the premises. Yet, such
explanations do not have the same status as more entrenched truth-conditional
and inferential conceptions of logical consequence, which suggests that
information-talk about logic is simply redundant. When, by contrast, we focus
on how logic can clarify the nature and dynamics of information, we turn our
attention to specific developments in philosophical logic, like logics of
knowledge and belief and their many dynamic extensions. While this opens up an
entirely new field of formal investigations — often dubbed the dynamic and
interactive turn in logic — it is less clear whether such developments
establish a special connection between logic and information (after all, there
are plenty of logics of X whose existence and usefulness does not imply a
special connection between logic and what it is used for).

At least since Carnap and Bar-Hillel's theory of semantic information, many
closer connections between logic and information have been developed by,
amongst others, Barwise & Perry, Corcoran, and Hintikka. More recently, the
simultaneaous rise of the philosophy of information and the dynamic and
interactive turn in logic has led to a revival of the question of how
information and logic can be related. In this workshop we want to approach the
subject from the perspective of the philosophy of information, as well as from
a logical perspective, and draw attention to a number of questions that have
received more attention, or have only been individuated in recent years. These
include the possibility of a genuine informational conception of logical
consequence, the relation between informational and computational approaches,
the relation between information and logics of questions, and the difference
between (what van Benthem calls) implicit informational stances in logic like
that of intuitionist logic and explicit stances like that of epistemic logic.
