Version 1.0 for 2013 of our Introduction to the Philosophy of Information is
now available as a

of this version will soon be integrated in the redesign of the teaching-
section. The beta-version from last year will provisionally remain accessible
through the Table of Content in the [teaching
section](http://socphilinfo.org/teaching/book-pi-intro), and an experimental
version for tablets can be accessed
[here](http://i2piasimpleintroduction.businesscatalyst.com/).
