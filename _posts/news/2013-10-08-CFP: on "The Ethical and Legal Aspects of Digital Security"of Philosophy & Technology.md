title: 'CFP: on "The Ethical and Legal Aspects of Digital Security"of Philosophy &
  Technology'

**Guest Editors: Pompeu Casanovas and Ugo Pagallo**

Security is one of the main issues of contemporary societies, and so are
transparency and the preservation of civil rights. New trends in the field of
governance —such as Privacy Impact Assessment methodology and Data Protection
by Design— require a more careful analysis of the social knowledge and ethical
aspects implied in the enactment of soft law, principles, rules and best
practices, as recently highlighted by the drafting of new European
regulations. Recent political turmoils fuel this intellectual need. Ethical
and legal challenges of the balance between security (e.g. procedures, content
and boundaries of police interoperability) and data protection (as defined
e.g. by legal provisions and enacted by national agencies) will be faced in
this Special issue.
