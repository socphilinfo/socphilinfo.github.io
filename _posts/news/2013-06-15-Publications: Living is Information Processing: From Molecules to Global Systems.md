**Abstract**  
We extend the concept that life is an informational phenomenon, at every level
of organisation, from molecules to the global ecological system. According to
this thesis: (a) living is information processing, in which memory is
maintained by both molecular states and ecological states as well as the more
obvious nucleic acid coding; (b) this information processing has one overall
function—to perpetuate itself; and (c) the processing method is filtration
(cognition) of, and synthesis of, information at lower levels to appear at
higher levels in complex systems (emergence). We show how information
patterns, are united by the creation of mutual context, generating persistent
consequences, to result in ‘functional information’. This constructive process
forms arbitrarily large complexes of information, the combined effects of
which include the functions of life. Molecules and simple organisms have
already been measured in terms of functional information content; we show how
quantification may be extended to each level of organisation up to the
ecological. In terms of a computer analogy, life is both the data and the
program and its biochemical structure is the way the information is embodied.
This idea supports the seamless integration of life at all scales with the
physical universe. The innovation reported here is essentially to integrate
these ideas, basing information on the ‘general definition’ of information,
rather than simply the statistics of information, thereby explaining how
functional information operates throughout life.
