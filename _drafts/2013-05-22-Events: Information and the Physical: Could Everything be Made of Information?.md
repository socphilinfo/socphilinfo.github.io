**Abstract**

Developments in Quantum Information Theory have given momentum to the idea
that information, not ordinary matter or physical stuff (particles and
fields), might constitute the world. I will investigate what sense, if any,
can be made of this proposal, and discuss whether it is indeed supported by
developments in Quantum Information Theory. On the way, positive accounts will
be given of the nature a) of the ordinary semantic and epistemic notion of
information, and b) of the technical notions of information in classical and
quantum information theories.
