I just became aware of

    
    
     Vermeersch, Etienne (1963). Information and Philosophy. Philosophica 1.

Freely available here

<http://logica.ugent.be/philosophica/fulltexts/1-4.pdf>

a very early attempt to analyse "information" philosophically. There are
further references to earlier literature as well, mainly in cybernetic-
oriented contexts. All interesting from a historical perspective on the origin
of PI.
