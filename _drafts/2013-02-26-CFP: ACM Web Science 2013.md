### Social Science/Digital Humanities and Late-Breaking Research  
May 2-4, 2013. Paris, France

Deadline for abstracts: **March 16, 2013**  
[http://www.websci13.org](http://www.websci13.org/)

You still have time to submit an extended abstract for Web Science 2013.
Extended abstracts should describe either (1) thought-provoking ideas with the
potential for interesting discussions at the conference, or (2) works-in-
progress for sharing valuable ideas, eliciting feedback on early-stage work,
or fostering discussions and collaborations among colleagues. We particularly
seek extended abstracts from the full range of disciplines involved in Web
Science research. Archival publication is optional and if accepted you can
choose whether to have the paper appear in the proceedings. The conference
separates mode of presentation from mode of publication. The committee will
recommend the appropriate presentation mode for each paper.

Extended abstracts can be up to 6 pages, and should be formatted according to
the official [ACM SIG abstract template (extended abstract
format)](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/pl130rtd134fxu6/hiyzXgWwTs)

The full call is at <http://www.websci13.org/late-call/>
