There is a spectrum of different ways of understanding what information is.
These range from quantitative analyses–which treat information in terms of
uninterpreted patterns of data–to qualitative analyses, which treat
information semantically, as a matter of meaningful structures. What is the
relation between these different approaches? Are there invariants underlying
the different uses of the term ‘information’ in disciplines such as computer
science, economics, genetics, neuroscience, physics, and statistics? Is there
some sort of logic, which transcends these different uses? How, for example,
are we able to transform quantitative information deriving from meteorological
sensors into the sorts of qualitative information that is useful for human
decision-making? According to Shannon and Weaver, information refers to the
degree of uncertainty present in a message. Does a view along these lines
provide a viable starting point for a unified analysis of information, or must
we look elsewhere? This issue of The Monist will take questions such as these
as a basis for fostering new research in the philosophy of information.

Intending authors are encouraged to make direct contact with the Advisory
Editor and to refer to the submission guidelines when preparing their work for
submission.
