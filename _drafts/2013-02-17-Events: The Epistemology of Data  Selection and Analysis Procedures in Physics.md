The research collaboration "Epistemology of the LHC" organizes an
interdisciplinary workshop entitled "The Epistemology of Data Selection and
Analysis Procedures in Physics," which will take place at Wuppertal University
from March 7-9, 2013. The workshop will bring together physicists,
philosophers of science as well as historians and sociologists of science. The
aim is a better understanding of processes of data handling, such as selection
or reduction, with a certain but not exclusive focus on the physical sciences.

Talks will be given by Sibylle Anderl, Allan Franklin, Gerd Grasshoff, Giora
Hon, Hannes Jung, Koray Karaca, Michael Kraemer, Martina Merz, Margaret
Morrison, Kent Staley, Wolfgang Wagner, and Adrian WÃ¼thrich.

Information on the program of the workshop and talks to be given can be found
