Via Luciano Floridi:

Dear All,

amazing how useful it is to read the classics 8-)



I hope you will enjoy this lucid, one-page warning from Shannon.

If philosophers had read it and understood it before mixing quantitative and
qualitative approaches to information, we would have saved much time and
avoided many mistakes.

  

Cheers,

Luciano
