Philosophy of Information - The Value of Information

http://www.american.edu/cas/economics/info-

WORKSHOP OBJECTIVES

The overall objective of this workshop is to study some of the open questions
within philosophy of information with an emphasis on the study of the value of
information and the philosophy of information processing.

Interest in the philosophy and meaning of information goes back half a century
but has rapidly increased recently with many new directions of research into
the meaning, quantification and measures of information and complexity as well
as a vast range of applications across the scientific spectrum.

In our first workshop on the topic (October, 2011) we focused on one aspect of
the philosophy of information: the different techniques to measure information
and to identify meaningful information.

Building on our earlier workshop and recent development, in this workshop we
focus on a number of related aspects of the philosophy of information and the
philosophy of info-metrics. These topics include the value of information,
quantifying information, processing complementary and contradicting
information and the inter-relationship between information, computation and
complexity.

This one day workshop will address these basic questions and will explore
recent advances in the philosophy of information and its potential
applications.
