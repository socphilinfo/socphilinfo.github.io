title: 'CFP: The Student Session of the Third East-Asian School on Logic, Language
  and Computation (EASLLC 2014)'
---
The Third East-Asian School on Logic, Language and Computation (EASLLC 2014)
will take place at Tsinghua University, China on July 2-8, 2014.  The event
will start with an international workshop “Current Trends in Logic” on July 2,
continue with the school on July 3-8. The program of the School will consist
of six courses on logic in its interdisciplinary width. The courses cover
logic, philosophy, computer science, and linguistics, with an emphasis on
interaction between fields. There will be two plenary evening talks for a
wider audience.

In addition, there will be student sessions in the late afternoon/early
evening. The student session is a forum for students at all levels (Bachelor,
Master or PhD) to present original research to the audience. We plan a
"mentoring" program in which selected students will be assigned to one of the
lecturers for informal interaction and research/career discussions.

We invite submissions of abstracts of original, unpublished papers from
students in the area of logic, language and computation. Submissions will be
reviewed by several experts in the field. Authors of accepted papers will be
invited to present in the student session, and a selected number of them will
be provided with free reasonable accommodation.

**Instruction for Authors:**

Students are invited to submit an abstract of maximum 5 pages on any topic in
logic, language and computation. The abstract should be written in properly
readable English, and must be in PDF format that is to be submitted using our
[EasyChair website](https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=easllc2014).



**Important Dates:**

April 1, 2014 \- deadline for short abstracts of papers (at most 5 pages)

April 20, 2014 \- notification date of acceptance/rejection of the papers
