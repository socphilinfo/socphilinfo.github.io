title: 'Events: Workshop - Information Systems and the Four-Category Ontology'
---
## **Department of Philosophy, Durham University**  
20 th-21st May 2013

<http://www.dur.ac.uk/philosophy/events/informationsystemsandthefourcategoryontologyws/>

**Call for Abstracts – Deadline: Friday 19th April 2013**

This two-day workshop will bring together metaphysicians, applied ontologists
and information systems theorists to discuss the practical application of a
four-category ontology to the design of information systems.

 This workshop aims to put advocates of four-category ontologies into direct
dialogue with applied ontologists and information systems designers, enabling
each to update the other on developments within their disciplines and to share
concerns and problems for collective discussion.

Specific foci of the workshop will be (i) the presentation of practical
problems in the design of information systems and (ii) the discussion of
contemporary developments in the four-category ontology whose practical
applications are not yet appreciated.

## **Invited speakers**

  * Nicola Guarino, Laboratory for Applied Ontology, Trento
  * Ludger Jansen, University of Rostock
  * E. J. Lowe, Durham University
  * Luc Schnieder, Institute for Formal Ontology and Medical Information Science
  * Barry Smith, University at Buffalo

## **Abstracts**

We invite abstracts of 300-500 words for presentations of half an hour,
followed by fifteen minutes for discussion, on topics related to the aims of
the workshop. Please prepare these for blind review and submit to a.d.carruth
