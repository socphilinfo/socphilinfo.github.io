This is a SPI-supported event.

conference.ugent.be/hapop2)  
  
At AISB-50, Goldsmiths, London  
1-4, April 2014  
  
As part of the AISB-50 Annual Convention 2014 to be held at Goldsmiths,
University of London, on April 1st--4th 2014  
  
[www.aisb.org.uk/events/aisb14](http://www.aisb.org.uk/events/aisb14)  
  
The convention is organised by the Society for the Study of Artificial
Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour  (AISB)  
  
<http://www.aisb.org.uk/>  
  
Overview  
The history and philosophy of computing only started to develop as real
disciplines in the ’80s and ’90s of the previous century, with the foundation
of journals (e.g. the IEEE Annals on the History of Computing, Minds and
Machines and the like) and associations (SIGCIS, IACAP, . . . ), and the
organization of conferences and workshops on a regular basis. A historical
awareness of the evolution of computing not only helps to clarify the complex
structure of the computing sciences, but it also provides an insight in what
computing was, is and maybe could be in the future. Philosophy, on the other
hand, helps to tackle some of the fundamental problems of computing. The aim
of this symposium is to zoom into one fundamental aspect of computing, that is
the foundational and the historical problems and developments related to the
science of programming.  
This is the Second Symposium on History and Philosophy of Programming,
following the first edition organized in 2012 at the AISB/IACAP Joint
Convention in Birmingham, UK.  
  
It is supported by the Commission on the History and Philosophy of Computing
(<http://www.hapoc.ugent.be/home>).  
  
A historical awareness of the evolution of computing not only helps to clarify
the complex structure of the computing sciences, but it also provides an
insight in what computing was, is and maybe could be in the future.
Philosophy, on the other hand, helps to tackle some of the fundamental
problems of computing. The aim of this symposium is to zoom into one
fundamental aspect of computing, that is the foundational and the historical
problems and developments related to programming.  
  
  
Topics of Interest  
That a logico-mathematical-physical object called program is so controversial,
even though its very nature is mostly hidden away, is rooted in the range of
problems, processes and objects that can be solved, simulated, approximated
and generated by way of its execution. Given its widespread impact on our
lives, it becomes a responsibility of the philosopher and the historian to
study the science of programming. The historical and philosophical reflection
on the science of programming is the main topic at the core of this workshop
and we expect contributions (talks) in the following aspects (and their
connections):  
  
1.    The history of computational systems, machines and programs   
2.    Foundational issues and paradigms of programming   
3.    Methodology of designing, teaching and learning programming   
  
We believe the scientific community needs a deep understanding and critical
view of the problems related to the scientific paradigm represented by the
science of programming. Possible and in no way exclusive questions that might
be of relevance to this Symposium are:  
  
•    What was and is the relation between hardware and software developments?  
•    How did the notion of ‘program’ changed since the 40s?  
•    How important has been the hands-off vs. the hands-on approach for the
development of programming?  
•    How did models of computability like Church’s lambda-calculus influence
the development of programming languages?  
•    Is programming a science or a technology?  
•    What are the novel and most interesting approaches to the design of
programs?  
•    What is correctness for a program?  Issues in Type-checking, Model-
checking, etc.  
•    How do we understand programs as syntactical-semantical objects?  
•    What is the nature of the relation between algorithms and programs?  What
is a program?  
•    How can epistemology profit from the understanding of programs’ behavior
and structure?  
•    What legal and socio-economical issues are involved in the creation,
patenting or free-distribution of programs?  
•    How is programming to be taught?  
  
  
Submission and Publication Details  
Submissions must be full (short) papers and should be sent via EasyChair:  
  
<https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hapop2>  
  
  
Text editor templates from a previous convention can be found at:  
  
<http://www.aisb.org.uk/convention/aisb08/download.html>  
  
We request that submitted papers are limited to eight pages. Each paper will
receive at least two reviews. Selected papers will be published in the general
proceedings of the AISB Convention, with the proviso that at least ONE author
attends the symposium in order to present the paper and participate in general
symposium activities.  
  
  
Important Dates  
  
    Full paper submission deadline: 3 January 2014   
    Notification of acceptance/rejections: 6 February 2014   
    Final version of accepted papers: 24 february 2014   
    Convention: 1-4 April 2014 (symposium date tbc)  
  
  
Additional Information  
Please note that there will be separate proceedings for each symposium,
produced before the convention. Each delegate will receive a memory stick
containing the proceedings of all the symposia. In previous years there have
been awards for the best student paper, and limited student bursaries. These
details will be circulated as and when they become available. Authors of a
selection of the best papers will be invited to submit an extended version of
the work to a journal special issue.
