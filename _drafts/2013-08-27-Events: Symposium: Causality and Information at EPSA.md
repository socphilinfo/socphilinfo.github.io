title: 'Events: Symposium: Causality and Information at EPSA'

[This year's
programme](http://www.helsinki.fi/epsa13/Materials/EPSA13%20Abstract%20Book.pdf)
of the conference of the European Philosophy of Science Association
([EPSA](http://www.helsinki.fi/epsa13/)) features a symposium on 'Causality
and Information'.

This symposium aims to look at causality in an overarching way, removing
barriers in academic work focusing on different scientific domains, and
bridging philosophy of science and philosophy of technology, which have
different approaches to philosophical problems.

Paper 1 sets the context in the philosophy of science, examining the
difference between causality as production and as dependence. The paper delves
into the problems a productive account of   causality is supposed to solve,
and examines  how informational approaches to causality might  help. Paper 2
uses biomarkers  research as  a test case for  an informational account,
illustrating how with  messy complex  interacting  causal factors,  with
great uncertainty,  the  idea of tracing  a causal  link  can  still  be vital
to  the  scientific practice – and illuminated informationally. Paper 3 tests
the informational approach  on  a  challenging  problem – agency.  Agency
theories struggle to offer  an  account  of  causality  that is  neither
circular  nor anthropocentric,  and  this is  analogous to  certain  problems
in addressing  information. If an informational approach is useful in this and
other problem cases, then it might also illuminate other areas. Paper 4 takes
a significant further step, laying the ground for an entirely  different
perspective on causality  with respect  to our knowledge, by examining an
aspect of the  problem of causality  that  naturally arises  in  the
philosophy  of  technology,  but is  not  addressed in the philosophy of
science: poiesis.

As a whole, the  papers examine developing thinking about   causality   and
show  that  for  many   cutting-edge  problems, an  informational   account
is an  original and fruitful  way  forward.
