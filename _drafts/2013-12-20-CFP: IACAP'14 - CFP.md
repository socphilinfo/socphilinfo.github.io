For abstracts, we request anonymous submission of 600-1000 words (plus
references) in plain text or PDF, plus a short abstract of up to 120 words.
All submissions will be reviewed double-blind by at least two members of the
programme committee. All submissions of paper abstracts - whether to the main
track or to symposia - are made centrally on the same site and all reviewing
takes place on that site.  
  
For symposia, please provide a brief motivation (ca. 300 words), a list of
envisaged speakers, and indication of time needed (full day, half day, etc.).
The submission procedure and reviewing for symposia will be taken care of by
their organisers - but within the structure provided by IACAP and the
submission system for this conference.
