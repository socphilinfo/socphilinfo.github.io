  of Biology 8th Annual Conference '

Information concepts pervade biology—transcription, translation, noise,
redundancy, computation, network, complexity, processing, signal, digital,
code, blueprint – yet, questions about what information is, how it is to be
measured, and whether such notions are even useful in science, remain
unanswered. For example, in evolutionary studies, the notion of information
transfer is commonplace: DNA stores information that is later transmitted
along a signaling pathway and translated by a ribosome. How can we both
qualitatively as well as quantitatively analyze this information, and how
might other disciplines such as computer science, neuroscience, and genetics
shed some light on the theory and application of information in biology?
Appealing to the metaphor and language of information theory is tempting, but
understanding how these information concepts are related, useful, and
meaningful, is a challenge. “Information & Transmission” will examine these
questions, as well as the relationship between the philosophy of information
and the philosophy of biology.

This year the conference is hosted by Duke’s Center for the Philosophy of
Biology, and cosponsored by Duke’s Biology Department, Computer Science
Department, IGSP and the Bass Connections Information, Society & Culture
Theme.
