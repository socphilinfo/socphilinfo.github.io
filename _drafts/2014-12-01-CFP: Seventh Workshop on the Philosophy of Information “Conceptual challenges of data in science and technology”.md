### Submission information

Send your 500-1000 words abstract by 23rd January 2015 in doc, docx, txt, rft
or pdf format, suitable for anonymous review, to phyllis.illari@ucl.ac.uk.

Issues of interest include (but are not limited to): Causality: how should we
find causes in the era of ‘data-driven science’? do we need a new conception
of causality to fit with new practices? Quality: how should we ensure that
data are good enough quality for the purposes for which we use them? What
should we make of the open access movement; what kind of new technologies
might be needed? Security: how can we adequately secure data, while making it
accessible to those who need it? Big data: what defines big data as a new
scientific method?; what is it and what are the challenges? Uncertainty: can
big data help with uncertainty, or does it merely generate new uncertainties?
what technologies are essential to reduce uncertainty elements in data-driven
sciences?

All good quality abstracts on the broad areas described above will be given
serious consideration. Abstracts will be refereed by members of the board of
the Society.

### Important Dates

23 January 2015: Deadline for submission (CLOSED)

13 February 2015: Notification of acceptance

Each workshop is a small scale gathering, with an open Call for Papers to
present works in the large variety of research areas that focus on
information, both in scientific and conceptual terms. This includes works in
progress and we aim at discussing open problems in the area. For a brief
presentation of the topics covered by this branch of philosophy, see
http://www.socphilinfo.org/about-pi/about-pi.

The Workshop series has had publications in the following Journals: Synthese,
Logique & Analyse, Minds & Machines, Topoi. We hope to offer presenters to the
Seventh Workshop the chance to submit papers for a Special Issue in a renowned
Journal.
