## Abstract

The phenomenon of digital computation is explained (often differently) in
computer science, computer engineering and more broadly in cognitive science.
Although the semantics and implications of malfunctions have received
attention in the philosophy of biology and philosophy of technology, errors in
computational systems remain of interest only to computer science.
Miscomputation has not gotten the philosophical attention it deserves. Our
paper fills this gap by offering a taxonomy of miscomputations. This taxonomy
is underpinned by a conceptual analysis of the design and implementation of
conventional computational systems at various levels of abstraction. It shows
that ‘malfunction’ as it is typically used in the philosophy of artefacts only
represents one type of miscomputation.
