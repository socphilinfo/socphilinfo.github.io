Argumentation is an important and exciting topic in Artificial Intelligence,
where uses of argumentation have increased in recent years, throughout a
variety of subdisciplines. Research activities range from theory to
applications. The CLIMA XIV Special Session on Argumentation Technologies is
intended to be a forum to discuss concepts, theories, methodologies, and
applications of computational models of argumentation.

**We invite submissions related to (but not limited to) one or more of the
following topics:**

* Computational models of (natural) argument

* Argumentation in artificial societies

* Argumentation in social networks

* Argumentation in multi-agent systems

* Dialogues, negotiation and dynamic aspects in argumentation

* Argument-based interaction and persuasion

* Innovative applications of computational argumentation

* Agreement technologies

Detailed information regarding CLIMA, its topics of interest, the two Special
Sessions, formatting and submission instructions is available at
http://centria.di.fct.unl.pt/events/climaXIV/

**Important dates:**

* Submission: June 6th (Abstracts) / June 10th (Papers) (Strict)

* Notification: June 24th

* Camera Ready: July 4th
