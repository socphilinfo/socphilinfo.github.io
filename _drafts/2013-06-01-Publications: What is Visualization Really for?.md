What is Visualization Really for?

http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5670

Whenever a visualization researcher is asked about the purpose of
visualization, the phrase "gaining insight" by and large pops out
instinctively. However, it is not absolutely factual that all uses of
visualization are for gaining a deep understanding, unless the term insight is
broadened to encompass all types of thought. Even when insight is the focus of
a visualization task, it is rather difficult to know what insight is gained,
how much, or how accurate. In this paper, we propose that "saving time" in
accomplishing a user's task is the most fundamental objective. By giving
emphasis to saving time, we can establish a concrete metric, alleviate
unnecessary contention caused by different interpretations of insight, and
stimulate new research efforts in some aspects of visualization, such as
empirical studies, design optimisation and theories of visualization.
