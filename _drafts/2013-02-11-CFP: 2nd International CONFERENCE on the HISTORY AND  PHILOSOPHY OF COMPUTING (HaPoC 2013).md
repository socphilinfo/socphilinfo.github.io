CALL FOR PAPERS, 2nd International CONFERENCE on the HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF
COMPUTING (HaPoC 2013)  
28th - 31st October 2013  
Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris.

With a special session on "Computing and the Arts" at Ecole Nationale
Superieure des Arts Decoratifs  
<http://hapoc2013.sciencesconf.org>  
  
We are happy to announce that the 2nd International Conference on the History
and Philosophy of Computing (HaPoC 2013) will take place from  
the 28th to the 31st of October 2013 at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris
(France). The birth of the computing and its sciences has often been the topic
of philosophical and historical reflection. The HaPoC-conferences have decided
to bring together the historical and the philosophical viewpoints. They want
to create an environment for a true interdisciplinary convergence around
computer science, reenforcing research on the science(s) of computing and its
history and stimulating a theoretical dialogue between these domains. To
furter this dialogue HaPoC has chosen to have no parallel sessions.

Our invited speakers are: Janet Abbate; Bernard Chazelle (tbc); Walter Dean;
Nathan Ensmenger; Jean-Yves Girard; Barbara Liskov (tbc); Margit  
Rosen and Franck Varenne.

HaPoC 2013 is the follow-up conference to HaPoC 2011 (Gent, Belgium).

  
Please check out the website of HaPoC 2013 for more information on the
