## Tutorial at the [5th World Congress and School on Universal
Logic](http://www.uni-log.org/school5.html?school=School).

Lecturer: Patrick Allo

Description:

The tutorial consists of three parts.

A first part covers the contrast between, on the one hand, the naturalness of
characterisations of logical consequence in terms of information-containment,
and, on the other hand, the perceived redundancy of informational notions in
the formal characterisation of logical consequence. As part of this
discussion, we review the seminal characterisation of semantic information due
to Carnap & Bar-Hillel, Corcoran’s information-theoretic characterisation, and
informational interpretations of substructural logic.

A second part deals with the influence of the dynamic and interactive turn in
logic on how we perceive the relation between logic and information. In
particular we consider how a conception of information as a distributed
commodity brings many informational or communicative actions within the scope
of logic.

In a third part we identify common themes in the study of logic and
information, explore new challenges for our thinking about logic and
information that are inspired by the philosophy of information and the
philosophy of computation.
