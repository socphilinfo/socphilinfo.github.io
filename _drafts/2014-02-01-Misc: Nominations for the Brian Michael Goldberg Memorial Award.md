title: 'Misc: Nominations for the Brian Michael Goldberg Memorial Award'
---
The International Association for Computing and Philosophy is proud to present
the “Brian Michael Goldberg Memorial Award” to graduate students in
recognisance of outstanding achievements in the areas of Computing and
Philosophy.

This award is sponsored by the Department of Philosophy at Carnegie Mellon and
carries a $500 USD stipend, which will be presented each year at one of the
IACAP conferences. Nominees and applicants are welcome from around the world.

This Award was made possible by a generous gift from Dr. Gerald and Nancy
Goldberg in memory of their son, Brian Michael Goldberg. In their words:

Brian was a twenty-two year old student who was admitted to Carnegie Mellon
University in 1991 to the doctoral program in philosophy. He died unexpectedly
before he could realize his dream of attending Carnegie Mellon. Brian was an
independent thinker who loved competition and a good challenge. Throughout his
life, he found it exciting to enter and win contests. He loved challenging his
mind, especially by studying philosophy, mathematics and logic. He loved
challenging his creativity through photography, painting and theatre arts. He
loved challenging his body by learning such diverse sports as wrestling,
fencing and scuba diving. He loved debating and challenging others to think in
new ways and had seriously considered becoming a university professor. To
honor who he was and what he loved, this Goldberg Memorial Award is offered to
challenge and motivate other graduate students in Brian’s chosen field of
study.
