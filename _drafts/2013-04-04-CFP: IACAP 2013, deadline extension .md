The conference will be held at the University of Maryland at College Park.
July 15-17 2013

**“Minds, Machines and Morals”**  

This generation has borne witness to a veritable explosion in the use of
computing technologies in almost every aspect of life.   Philosophers,
scientists, and technologists/engineers have an important role to play in
addressing the foundational questions that arise on the inexorable march
toward intelligent machines.  This year’s theme is “Minds, Machines and
Morals.”  Questions regarding the status of machines as moral agents and
patients press on us as we envision a future filled with self-driving cars,
robotic surgeons, health-care providers, and online computational surrogates.
According to what principles should they behave, if any?  How much autonomy
should they be granted, and how might they interact with human partners
before, during, and after engaging in action accompanied by moral
deliberation?  What is the nature of the folk concepts that drive our ordinary
ascriptions of blame and praise?  Is it necessary for machines to be sensitive
to the vicissitudes of human moral cognition in context, and if so, how might
these be computationally instantiated in systems built to work side-by-side
with people?  Finally, how can traditional moral philosophy contribute to this
emerging picture of human-machine interaction?  We encourage the submission of
novel work on these and related issues.  We remain especially interested in
the kind of interdisciplinary investigations that have been typical of our
meetings as we seek to reach out to cognitive scientists, neuroscientists,
social psychologists and experimental philosophers in further developing our
understanding of moral minds and moral machines. Work in other areas
traditionally of interest to the computing and philosophy community is invited
as well.
