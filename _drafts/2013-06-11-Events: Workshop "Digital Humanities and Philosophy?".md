title: 'Events: Workshop "Digital Humanities and Philosophy?"'
---
The Digital Humanities are booming. However, philosophy is underrepresented in
the Digital Humanities. This workshop has three aims: (i) to present
computational methods that can be used by philosophers; (ii) to present
research in which philosophical problems are studied by means of computational
methods; (iii) to reflect on the relevance of research in the Digital
Humanities for research in the humanities and philosophy.

Everyone interested in the digital humanities and philosophy is cordially
invited!

Attendance is free, but please *register *by sending an e-mail to
