## THE INFORMATION SOCIETY AT THE CROSSROADS  
Response and Responsibility of the Sciences of Information

Vienna University of Technology, June 3-7, 2015

The [International Society for Information Studies](http://is4is.org/) (ISIS)
holds every 2 years a conference. The ISIS Summit Vienna 2015 is the first
conference of that kind. It is organised under the guidance of the current
president of ISIS, Wolfgang Hofkirchner, at the university he is affiliated
to. It will be continued in 2017 by then ISIS president Gordana Dodig-Crnkovic
in Gothenburg, Sweden.

The aim of the summit is to bring together different communities that research
into information (which shall be understood just as a generic term for
cognition, communication, co-operation; data, knowledge, wisdom; intelligence;
and the whole diversity of related terms), develop or implement applications
of their findings (be they technological or social) or use those applications.
That is, not only representatives of different disciplines meet but also the
latter meet with different stakeholders. The summit shall help discuss the
betterment of society. Thus it is an endeavour in transdisciplinarity.

The ISIS Summit Vienna 2015 is called summit also because it is supported by
co-initiators (networks and institutions that hold their regular meeting as
conference stream together with our summit), by co-organisers (networks,
institutions and groups of people that take over the responsibility for
organising tracks) and by partners.
