title: "CFP: Workshop on Logic and Information (5th UNILOG) \u2014 Deadline Extended"
---
Workshop at the Fifth World Conference on Universal Logic  
25-30 June 2015  
University of Istanbul

In this workshop we want to approach the relation between logic and
information from the perspective of the philosophy of information, as well as
from a logical perspective, and draw attention to a number of questions that
have historically received attention, or have only been individuated in recent
years. These include the possibility of a genuine informational conception of
logical consequence, the relation between informational and computational
approaches, the relation between information and logics of questions, and the
difference between (what van Benthem calls) implicit informational stances in
logic like that of intuitionist logic and explicit stances like that of
epistemic logic.
