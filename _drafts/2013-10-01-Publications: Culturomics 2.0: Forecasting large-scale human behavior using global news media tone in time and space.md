title: 'Publications: Culturomics 2.0: Forecasting large-scale human behavior using
  global news media tone in time and space'
---
News is increasingly being produced and consumed online, supplanting print and
broadcast to represent nearly half of the news monitored across the world
today by Western intelligence agencies. Recent literature has suggested that
computational analysis of large text archives can yield novel insights to the
functioning of society, including predicting future economic events. Applying
tone and geographic analysis to a 30–year worldwide news archive, global news
tone is found to have forecasted the revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya,
including the removal of Egyptian President Mubarak, predicted the stability
of Saudi Arabia (at least through May 2011), estimated Osama Bin Laden’s
likely hiding place as a 200–kilometer radius in Northern Pakistan that
includes Abbotabad, and offered a new look at the world’s cultural
affiliations. Along the way, common assertions about the news, such as “news
is becoming more negative” and “American news portrays a U.S.–centric view of
the world” are found to have merit.
