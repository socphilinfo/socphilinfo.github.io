## Overview

Today’s blockbuster video games—and their never-ending sequels, sagas, and
reboots—provide plenty of excitement in high-resolution but for the most part
fail to engage a player’s moral imagination. In Beyond Choices, Miguel Sicart
calls for a new generation of video and computer games that are ethically
relevant by design. In the 1970s, mainstream films—including The Godfather,
Apocalypse Now, Raging Bull, and Taxi Driver—filled theaters but also treated
their audiences as thinking beings. Why can’t mainstream video games have the
same moral and aesthetic impact? Sicart argues that it is time for games to
claim their place in the cultural landscape as vehicles for ethical
reflection.

Sicart looks at games in many manifestations: toys, analog games, computer and
video games, interactive fictions, commercial entertainments, and independent
releases. Drawing on philosophy, design theory, literary studies, aesthetics,
and interviews with game developers, Sicart provides a systematic account of
how games can be designed to challenge and enrich our moral lives. After
discussing such topics as definition of ethical gameplay and the structure of
the game as a designed object, Sicart offers a theory of the design of ethical
game play. He also analyzes the ethical aspects of game play in a number of
current games, including Spec Ops: The Line, Beautiful Escape: Dungeoneer,
Fallout New Vegas, and Anna Anthropy’s Dys4Ia. Games are designed to evoke
specific emotions; games that engage players ethically, Sicart argues, enable
us to explore and express our values through play.

## Endorsements

“Ethics in video games can be approached from many angles, from analysis of
cheating strategies, to the political perspective inherent in game mechanics,
to the inclusion of dodgy narrative subject matter, to social concerns about
faux violence. This book is an effort to bring these conversations away from
private chats and conference coffee conversations, and make them accessible to
all those fascinated with the subject of what games are and what they might
become.”

“ _In Beyond Choices_ , Miguel Sicart casts light not only on designing games
that pose moral choices for players, but more generally on techniques that can
be used to foster subtext—meaning beyond the surface—in games of all kinds.
Designers—at least those interested in creating something more than a
reskin—will find it of compelling interest.”  
— **Greg Costikyan** , game designer; author of _Uncertainty in Games_
