Interesting quoatation from Ask a Philsopher website:

https://askaphilosopher.wordpress.com/2013/04/29/what-keeps-a-philosopher-
interested/

"Thus, many older contemporary philosophers grew up with an emphasis on
philosophy of language. This was succeeded by intense interest in philosophy
of mind. Now philosophy of information is the field for young academics."

Indeed
