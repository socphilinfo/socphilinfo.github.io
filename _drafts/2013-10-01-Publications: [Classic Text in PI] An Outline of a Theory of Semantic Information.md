Written in the wake of Shannon's Information Theory or Mathematical Theory of
Communication (MTC), this technical report is one of the first established
works on information in philosophy. Whereas MTC is a syntactic treatment of
information, concerned with the technical engineering aspects of
transmitting/communicating information and neglecting the semantic aspects,
Bar-Hillel and Carnap sought to develop a quantitative account of semantic
information.  
  
The journal article 'Semantic Information' provides a shorter overview of this
work:
