---
Technologies have profoundly shaped the human experience, and continue to do
so at an increasing pace, and with ever-expanding scope and impact. They are
radically modifying not only how we interact with our environments, shape
them, and make sense of them, but also how we understand ourselves and our
position and responsibilities in the world. Technologies have brought enormous
benefits and opportunities, but they also raise new and pressing challenges,
whose complexity and global dimensions are rapidly evolving. There is much
need for better understanding and new ideas.

PhilTech is the annual, multidisciplinary seminar series that brings prominent
and influential speakers to the Oxford Internet Institute in order to advance
critical understanding of the conceptual nature and practical consequences of
technologies, and to provide new ideas about their fruitful and sustainable
developments.

PhilTech is organised by Luciano Floridi and James Williams, with the support
of the Oxford Internet Institute, in collaboration with the Faculty of
Philosophy, University of Oxford, and with a sponsorship from the journal
Philosophy & Technology.

Join us for lunch and talks at the OII. For (free) registration and program
