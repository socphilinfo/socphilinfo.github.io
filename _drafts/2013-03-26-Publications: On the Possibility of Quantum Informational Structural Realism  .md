Abstract:

In The Philosophy of Information, Luciano Floridi presents an ontological
theory of Being qua Being, which he calls "Informational Structural Realism",
a theory which applies, he says, to every possible world. He identifies
primordial information ("dedomena") as the foundation of any structure in any
possible world. The present essay examines Floridi's defense of that theory,
as well as his refutation of "Digital Ontology" (which some people might
confuse with his own). Then, using Floridi's ontology as a starting point, the
present essay adds quantum features to dedomena, yielding an ontological
theory for our own universe, Quantum Informational Structural Realism, which
provides a metaphysical interpretation of key quantum phenomena, and
diminishes the "weirdness" or "spookiness" of quantum mechanics.
