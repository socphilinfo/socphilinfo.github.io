This is the first post of what should become a series of posts on randomly
chosen classic texts in the _philosophy of information_.

In “Epistemology without a Knowing Subject” Karl Popper introduces the  _Third
World of objective contents of thought_ and contrasts this with the first
world of physical objects and / or physical states, and the second world of
mental states. This is also the paper where he famously coined the term
_objective knowledge_ which had an influence on both information-science and
the philosophy of information. An excerpt:

> An objectivist epistemology which studies the third world [the objective
content of thoughts] can help to throw an immense amount of light upon the
second world of subjective consciousness, (. . . ); _but the converse is not
true_. (p. 338)

Methodology and Philosophy of Science III_ , B. Van Rotselaar and J.F. Staal,
ed., Amsterdam: Noth-Holland, 1968, p. 333-373.
