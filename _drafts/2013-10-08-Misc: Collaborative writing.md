One of the challenges of writing our Philosophy of Information
[textbook](http://socphilinfo.org/teaching/book-pi-intro) was finding the
right platform for working together with 10+ authors on a single writing-
project. Unlike the authors of the [HoTT-
book](http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/), we didn't opt for the most
advanced option, namely git and [GitHub](https://github.com/), but for a mix
of Word, SkyDrive, Google-Docs (now Google-drive), and Dropbox.

Collaborative writing has received a lot of attention lately, and a number of
new platforms, unsurprisingly with git often working in the background, have
appeared. A few of them are listed below:

  * [draftin](https://draftin.com/)

  * [authorea](https://authorea.com/)

  * [editorially](https://editorially.com/)

  * [writelatex](https://www.writelatex.com/)

  * [penflip](http://www.penflip.com/)   (not yet active)

Go ahead and take a look at it! Some of these platforms might play a role in
the future activities of the SPI.
