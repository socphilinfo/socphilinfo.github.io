updates).

The overall objective of this workshop is to study open questions within the
philosophy of information and information processing, with an emphasis on the
value of observed information and its measurement. Interest in the philosophy,
meaning and value of information goes back half a century but has rapidly
increased recently with many new directions of research into the meaning,
quantification and measures of information and its complexity. Theoretic
advances in these directions will have a huge impact on a wide range of real
world applications.
