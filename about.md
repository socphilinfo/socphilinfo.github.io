The Society for the Philosophy of Information (SPI) promotes the development of the Philosophy of Information into an independent and self-sustained philosophical field.

In order to achieve this goal, the SPI:

+ brings together researchers and scholars in the area harnessing the multidisciplinary and international nature of the Philosophy of Information; 
+ organises workshops, seminars, conferences and other similar activities to explore the philosophical issues concerning the concept and phenomena of information and its cognate notions;
+ publishes teaching material for undergraduate and graduate courses on the Philosophy of Information;
+ maintains a state-of-the-art collection of bibliographic resources;
+ fosters editorial projects and funding proposals.

In this way, the SPI offers concrete learning and research tools to students, while promoting the academic network and activities of junior and senior researchers whose work focuses on the Philosophy of Information.

Since the nineties, philosophical research has shown that information, both as a concept and as a phenomenon, is at the core of most of the issues of contemporary concern. New problems originating from the digitalisation of information, like online identity and privacy, the digital divide or the epistemic and ethical relevance of design, are investigated alongside new takes on traditional philosophical topics, like the nature of reality, the definition of knowledge, the logical properties of information or the theory of truth.

The conceptual and logical investigation of information cuts across many traditional areas of philosophical research, building a fruitful dialogue with other disciplines, ranging from mathematics and computer science to engineering, from political science to human sciences. Members of the SPI actively participate and contribute to this multidisciplinary effort shaping, in so doing, that new field of philosophy called Philosophy of Information.
