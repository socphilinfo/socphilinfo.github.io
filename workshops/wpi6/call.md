## Call for Abstracts (closed)

Submissions are invited for the Sixth Workshop on the Philosophy of
Information, which will take place at Duke University, 15thâ€“16th of May 2014.

The topic for this year will be Information Access, very broadly construed.
This includes social, legal, epistemological, logical and normative issues
that are related to the availability, accessibility and control of
information, as well as the implications of these considerations to other
philosophical problems. Submissions in all areas related to the philosophy of
information will, however, be considered.

The workshop consists of a main track and two special panels.

As part of the main track of the workshop, at least 10 slots of 45 minutes are
available for contributed talks. Abstracts of 500-1000 words should be
submitted no later than the 1st of March to Orlin Vakarelov at
[o.vakarelov@duke.edu](mailto:o.vakarelov@duke.edu).

Submissions will be evaluated by the programme committee, and acceptance
notifications will be issued by the 15th of March 2014.
