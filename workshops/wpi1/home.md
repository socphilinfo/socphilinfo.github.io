This is the website of the First Workshop on the Philosophy of Information.
The workshop is an official event of the
[IEG](http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/research/areas/ieg/%29,), and is
generously supported by the Faculty of Philosophy.

The workshop proceedings were published in a special issue of
[Synthese](http://www.springerlink.com/content/0039-7857/167/2/
"http://www.springerlink.com/content/0039-7857/167/2/").

Place: the Philosophy Centre, 10 Merton Street, University of Oxford.

Time: 3-4 November, 2007.

The workshop has two main goals. First, to bring together some of the most
active researchers in the field, so that they may be exposed to and interact
with the latest research issues and results. Second, to encourage further
interdisciplinary work in the area, primarily between those working in
philosophy and computer science departments.

There is no workshop registration fee. We do however request an rsvp by Monday
October 29.

There will be a workshop dinner on the evening of Sunday November 4. The
dinner will be held at La Cucina, Oxford’s friendliest Italian restaurant. We
anticipate the dinner will come to approximately £30 per head. Rsvp for dinner
by Monday October 29.
