Send your 500-1000 words abstract by 23rd January 2015 in doc, docx, txt, rft
or pdf format, suitable for anonymous review, to phyllis.illari@ucl.ac.uk.

Issues of interest include (but are not limited to): Causality: how should we
find causes in the era of ‘data-driven science’? do we need a new conception
of causality to fit with new practices? Quality: how should we ensure that
data are good enough quality for the purposes for which we use them? What
should we make of the open access movement; what kind of new technologies
might be needed? Security: how can we adequately secure data, while making it
accessible to those who need it? Big data: what defines big data as a new
scientific method?; what is it and what are the challenges? Uncertainty: can
big data help with uncertainty, or does it merely generate new uncertainties?
what technologies are essential to reduce uncertainty elements in data-driven
sciences?

All good quality abstracts on the broad areas described above will be given
serious consideration. Abstracts will be refereed by members of the board of
the Society.
