title: Data Visualisation Drawing Workshop

---

Visual representation is essential both to the practice and the
communication of science. However, whereas drawing in the past played
a central role in fields such as morphology and embryology, the rise
of photographic and digital technologies and the growing emphasis on
molecules as opposed to whole organisms have increasingly marginalized
drawing practices. At the same time ‘big data’ and ‘data science’ has
emerged along with associated questions of imaging and representation.

This experimental drawing workshop aims to use drawing to develop
understanding of data, dimensionality and information and to share
this understanding as a group.
