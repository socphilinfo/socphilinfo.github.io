title: Ninth Workshop on the Philosophy of Information
subtitle: Call for papers
---

**closed**

The workshops in the Philosophy of Information bring together various
philosophical perspectives on the nature and dynamics of information, and
focus in particular on novel philosophical questions that arise in the
information society. The central theme for the 9th workshop in the series is
information visualisation.

We want to focus on informational artefacts that encode or convey information,
study how scientists rely on visualisations, and how visual artefacts are
designed. We want to be able to explain why visualisations can play a certain
epistemic role and formulate hypotheses about why certain visualisation are
more effective than others, but we also want to develop the conceptual
resources needed to critically assess design-choices and the conventions that
inform these decisions.

With the choice of visualisation as our central theme, we wish to explore
convergences between the philosophy of information and the philosophy of
science, and deepen existing connections between the formal sciences (logic,
computing) and the philosophy of information.

We welcome contributions on the following listed below, and encourage scholars
of various disciplinary backgrounds to explore the lines of inquiry we
proposed.

### Topics of interest

  * Extensions and critical evaluations of visualisations as models and as epistemic representations in the context of data-intensive science.
  * The epistemology of data and data science in the context of visualisation.
  * The logic and epistemology of design in the context of information visualisation.
  * Case-studies of specific visualisation-practices or types of visualisations; including drawings, photographs and diagrams.
  * Meta-theoretical reflections on the status of theoretical foundations for information visualisation.
  * The role of formal methods for the study of visualisation.

### Important Dates

  * Submission of abstracts (500 words): 30 March 2018 (**extended**)
  * Decisions: 15 April 2018
  * Programme available: 15 May 2018
  * Workshop: 26-27 June 2018 at the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and Arts in Brussels.
