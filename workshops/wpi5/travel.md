## Travel Information

### TRAVEL DIRECTIONS FROM LONDON, HEATHROW AIRPORT TO HATFIELD.

#### RAIL

This involves travelling by both underground (the 'Tube') and overground
trains.

First, take the Piccadilly line, eastbound, on the Underground system from
Heathrow to Kings Cross St. Pancras railway station.

The Piccadilly line (dark blue on the map) can be accessed from all Heathrow
terminals and a pdf version of the map can be found at:  
http://www.tfl.gov.uk/gettingaround/1106.aspx

The map is also available as a free app.

This leg of the journey will take approximately one hour.

Once you arrive at Kings Cross St. Pancras, follow the signs to (the newly
refurbished) St. Pancras station to catch an overground train to Hatfield. It
is a well-signposted, short walk on level ground with some escalators, and it
is well lit. There are always staff and police around who are very friendly
and happy to provide directions.

Second, you should aim for trains run by First Capital Connect.

Tickets can be purchased on the day and there is no need to book, although you
can if you so wish. Trains are frequent, running up to every ½ hour.

View timetables and plan your journey here:  
http://www.firstcapitalconnect.co.uk/?gclid=CNOX0M3D-q4CFUQhtAod0wvhxQ

This leg of your journey will take about 30 minutes.

Another useful website is www.thetrainline.com where you can check prices and
book tickets. Booking in advance is often cheaper than purchasing on the day
and tickets can be collected from machines at most railway stations.

It is then a short taxi ride, costing approximately £10 from the railway
station to the Hatfield hotels.

#### EUROSTAR

If you are coming to London on Eurostar, then you will arrive at Kings Cross
St Pancras International. From here it is a very short walk to St Pancras to
catch the train to Hatfield

#### COACH/BUS

National Express provides a direct coach service from Heathrow.

This departs for Hatfield from the Central Bus station every 2 hours. It is
located between terminals 1,2 and 3. There is an airport bus service linking
it to terminals 4 and 5. It is strongly recommended that you book in advance.

This can be done on the National Express website at:  
http://www.nationalexpress.com/coach/index.cfm?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_term=national+express&utm_campaign=Pure+Brand

The journey takes about 55 minutes. The coach stops outside the Galleria
shopping mall and from there it is a short walk to the hotels.

### FROM STANSTED AIRPORT TO HATFIELD

It is easier and quicker to use National Express buses (see link above) as the
rail journey involves travelling into London, and then changing trains, twice,
to reach Hatfield. Again, booking is strongly recommended and the journey
takes about 55 minutes.

### UNIVERSITY OF HERTFORDSHIRE
