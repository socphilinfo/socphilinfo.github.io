### Call for Abstracts

Extended Deadline

The general theme for this year is the role of data in biomedical sciences,
and should encourage an exchange between the philosophy and methodology of the
biomedical sciences and the philosophy of information about what it means to
use data as evidence or to use data as information for understanding, but also
for action (informing/supporting decisions).

Topics of interest include:

  * Epistemic standards for evidence
  * Evidence Based Medicine
  * Causation
  * Information in probabilistic and abductive reasoning
  * Data and information visualisation in biomedical sciences
  * Data and information in biomedical informatics
  * The value and importance of reproducible results
  * The place of negative results
  * Open data, and the distribution and re-use of data

Abstracts of 500-1000 words should be submitted no later than 15 March 2016 to
[socphilinfo@gmail.com](mailto:socphilinfo@gmail.com). **Extended to 1 April
2016.**  
Submissions will be evaluated by the programme committee, and acceptance
notifications will be issued by (postponed to)  **22 April** 2016.
